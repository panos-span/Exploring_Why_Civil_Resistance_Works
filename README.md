# Exploring Why Civil Resistance Works

In this assignment, you will replicate some of the findings of a well-received
book, [Why Civil Resistance Works](https://www.ericachenoweth.com/research/wcrw)
by [Erica Chenoweth](https://www.ericachenoweth.com/) and Maria J. Stephan. The two authors examined whether nonviolent
campaigns are more effective than violent campaigns. They found that yes; from a data set containing details of
campaigns from 1900 onwards, they found that in general peaceful campaigns are more effective in achieving their aims
than violent ones.
